# Render SPA Routing Configuration
# Note: Render may require dashboard configuration instead of this file
# Go to Render Dashboard → Settings → Redirects/Rewrites
# Add: Source: /*, Destination: /index.html, Status: 200

# This file is a fallback - Render may not read it automatically
# For assets to work, configure in Render Dashboard:
# - Add redirect: /* → /index.html (status 200)
# - But ensure assets are served directly (may need to exclude /assets/* from redirect)

/*    /index.html   200
