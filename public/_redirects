# Render SPA Routing Configuration
# This file ensures all routes redirect to index.html for React Router
# BUT excludes assets so they can be served directly

# Serve assets directly (no redirect)
/assets/*    /assets/:splat   200

# All other routes go to index.html for React Router
/*    /index.html   200
