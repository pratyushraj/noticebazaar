# 🔧 Configure SPA Routing in Render Dashboard

Based on your Render dashboard, here's how to enable SPA routing for clean URLs.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Redirects/Rewrites

1. In your Render dashboard for `noticebazaar-frontend`
2. Click **"Settings"** (already selected)
3. Under **"MANAGE"** section in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Redirects/Rewrites"**

### Step 2: Add SPA Rewrite Rule

1. Click **"Add Redirect"** or **"Add Rewrite"**
2. Configure:
   - **Source/From:** `/*`
   - **Destination/To:** `/index.html`
   - **Status Code:** `200` (IMPORTANT: Must be 200, not 301 or 302)
   - **Type:** Rewrite (if option available)

3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Switch Back to BrowserRouter

Once the rewrite rule is configured:

1. **Update code** to use BrowserRouter:
   ```typescript
   // In src/App.tsx, change:
   import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
   // To:
   import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   // And change:
   <HashRouter>
   // To:
   <BrowserRouter>
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add src/App.tsx
   git commit -m "Switch back to BrowserRouter - Render SPA routing configured"
   git push
   ```

### Step 4: Test

After Render redeploys:
- ✅ `/login` should work (clean URL, no hash)
- ✅ `/creator-dashboard` should work
- ✅ All routes should work with clean URLs

## 🎯 Alternative: If Redirects/Rewrites Doesn't Work

If you don't see the option or it doesn't work:

### Option A: Keep HashRouter (Current)

- URLs will use `#`: `/#/login`, `/#/creator-dashboard`
- Works immediately, no configuration needed
- Less SEO-friendly but functional

### Option B: Use Render's Headers Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Headers**
2. Add a custom header or rewrite rule
3. Configure to serve `index.html` for all routes

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ Custom domains configured: `noticebazaar.com` and `www.noticebazaar.com`
- ✅ Domain verified (green checkmark)
- ⏳ Certificate pending (will auto-generate)
- ⏳ Need to configure SPA routing in Redirects/Rewrites
- ✅ HashRouter working as temporary solution

---

## 🚀 Quick Action

1. **Click "Redirects/Rewrites"** in the left sidebar
2. **Add rewrite rule:** `/*` → `/index.html` (status 200)
3. **Save**
4. **Switch to BrowserRouter** in code
5. **Push and test**

Your custom domains are already set up! Once SPA routing is configured, you'll have clean URLs on `noticebazaar.com`.
